The "javaXML" package is a proof of concept program for XML encoding in the Java language, and it is the first program I have written in Java. The package does not use any imported packages, including regular expression packages, which could break down the large XML parsing function into a few lines. The code is meant to work with functional XML code, and it does not observe HTML code conventions.
